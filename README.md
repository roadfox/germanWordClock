# Arduino code for a german word clock
#  Swiss Layout adaption



- Based in mirohero's version
- ported to platformio IDE

I've printed the 96-LED word clock https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2130830 and I didn't find flashable code for the arduino or clones like NodeMCU. So I wrote this simple, wifi-synchronized code to flash with the Arduino IDE.


1. Include the external libraries FastLED.h, ESP8266WiFi.h and TimeClient.h
2. Change SSID, WiFi-password and the number of leds in the code
3. Flash the code with the arduino IDE
